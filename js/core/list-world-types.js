	"A barren world, with no atmosphere, few valuable resources, no water, under a ceaseless barrage of terrible radiation.",
	"A barren world, with little atmosphere, and a distant sun. It is a cold, dead place, where lonely wind blows perpetual across flat planes of dark ice and stone.",
	"A barren world rich in mineral wealth, cooling after a long period of tectonic activity. Massive thunderstorms lash the world, and methane ice storms accumulate into world-sculpting glaciers.",
	"A barren world encased in ice, with a deep subglacial sea. The surface trembles with asteroid impacts, and the worldâ€™s orbit trails ice and dust behind it.",
	"A barren world, old and close to its sun, where the mountains have eroded to sand, and the dunes are endless and white.",
	"A temperate world, lush, forever hazy under a thick mist that all but blocks out the sun.",
	"A temperate world, with myriad biomes, and skies piled high with columnar clouds.",
	"A temperate world, dry across great swathes of plainsland and desert, where vast alluvial deposits speak of rivers that once were.",
	"A temperate world of archipelagos scattered across a salton sea.",
	"A temperate world with a mild climate, rich in native flora and fauna, and old, stable biomes.",
	"An inhospitable world, whose atmosphere is thick and choking, with deep valleys that hold pockets of breathable air.",
	"An inhospitable world of storm-tossed nitrogen oceans and wind-polished cadmium islands, where tides surge and recede for years and no land is safe from the flood or retreat.",
	"An inhospitable world of lava and lightning, a new world, where there is no life to be found.",
	"An inhospitable world, scoured by a distant gamma ray burst, where the life that once was there has long since died off, and the land simmers with fires that never stop.",
	"An inhospitable world, cracked open by an ancient impact, its core bleeding heat into vacuum as it slowly dies.",
	"A temperate moon with a stable atmosphere, the curve of its horizon visible from even a modest mountaintop. Its parent world looms massive above it, ever-present in its day and night sky.",
	"An icy moon, cold and dim, one of many around its parent world. It absorbs the impacts of asteroids that would otherwise hit its counterpart.",
	"An ocean world, where there is no land.",
	"A barren world with a stable, if thin atmosphere. Massive geometric features and perfectly flat metal planes create an uncanny landscape; deep canals funnel moaning wind around the world.",
	"An ancient world, star red and swollen in its sky, where all things have a terrible symmetry, as if nature itself had oriented -- or been oriented -- around something now absent."
