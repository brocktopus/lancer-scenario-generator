  "Colonial Settlement - initial. There is a settlement here, but it was only recently seeded. Drones and subalterns work tirelessly, clearing space and assembling the initial colony footprint. A small cluster of buildings house the landfall team -- they are likely welcoming, as they’ve probably not seen anyone else for years. The population numbers in the dozens.",
  "Colonial Settlement - first generation. The colony settlement here is young, with its first generation of native-born colonists now of-age and set to the work of building their future home. The population numbers in the hundreds to thousands.",
  "Colonial Settlement - stable. The colonial settlement here is in its second or third generation, stable, with a population in the tens of thousands.",
  "Outpost - Union Far Field Team Mission. There is a FF Team outpost on this world, but nothing else in the way of human population.",
  "Outpost - Omninet Relay Node. The world is empty save for a lone omninet relay node. A small team crews the node, providing security and on-site technical support. They rotate on a regular schedule.",
  "Outpost - Union Navy SigInt Station. The UN maintains a small signals and intelligence station on this world. There may or may not be other populations here -- that is up to you -- but the SigInt station is in a remote, high-altitude part of the world.",
  "Outpost - Union Astrocartography Station. The world is marked with an orbital astrocartography station -- a suite of automated telescopes, sensors, and observational equipment used to map more distant stars and worlds.",
  "Outpost - Checkpoint/ Forward Post -- The world hosts a small Union garrison, most likely auxiliaries who report to a remote Union officer. Their duty is to scout, stand watch, and await further orders. They spend most of their time exercising, cleaning, maintaining their gear, and waiting for something to happen.",
  "Installation - Research Facility - The world hosts a Union, Corpro-State, or other state or private entity’s research facility. It may be a secure, top secret site, or it may not.",
  "Installation - Proving Ground. The world, or a significant part of it, is given over to a proving ground, test field, ordnance firing range, or other large-area hazardous testing, training, measuring, or dumping installation. Run by a small long-term skeleton crew, there typically is a larger short-term crew or population present during a given season or exercise.",
  "Installation - Deep Field Relay Installation. The world features a secure, long-range, planet-based sensor installation, typically located in a remote, high-altitude location. Populated by a small crew, the installation can be privately run or Union.",
  "Installation - Union Embassy. Generally only found on more developed worlds approaching or at Core status, Union Embassies are modest, centrally-located buildings typically sited in capital cities on capital worlds. They function as embassies do.",
  "Installation - Corpro-State Campus. This world features a publicly-accessible or off-limits CS campus with a large permanent population. This can be an enclave, an exclave, or integrated into a larger urban environment, and typically is an administrative center with some level of public exposure (even just notariety).",
  "Base - Union Naval System Command. The world is the site of a regional system command center for the Union Navy. Part base, part garrison, part shipyard, part recruitment center, part medical center, a UN SysComm facility is a large, removed, military base with a defensive perimeter, sunken launch pads, and hardened buildings and bunkers. It has a massive permanent population and a garrison numbering in the thousands, usually with a complement of ships in orbit with (at minimum) global strike and delivery capacity.",
  "Base - Capital. This world is the capital world of a system, and hosts the physical center of the system’s government, generally a campus, estate, block, or other large collection of hardened buildings charged with ministering to the state’s population. Generally speaking, there is some level of public access to this building, but only in more liberal states.",
  "Base - Uplift. This world has a spaceport, a sprawling launch facility open to the public (access subject to local laws, of course, beyond the basic ability to purchase a ticket offworld).",
  "Civic - Municipalities. The population of this world live in modest towns and cities scattered across biomes. The population numbers in the hundreds of millions. There may be one or two signature cities, but there are vast stretches of wilderness between them, and each municipality has developed their own take on global cultures.",
  "Civic - Arcology. The world’s population lives in one or more arcologies -- unified, self-contained ecosystem-cities -- in harmony with the world around and inside of them. They may be strictly monitored and walled-off from the larger world, or not. Worlds with arcologies as the primary urban centers tend to be well developed, with a history at least centuries long. The global population numbers in the hundreds of millions to single-digit billions.",
  "Civic - Metroswathe. Unlike an arcology or municipality, a world marked by metroswathes is heavily developed, with a significant percentage of the landmass given over to a single, amalgamated urban environment (<10-15%) that is home to billions. That it functions -- and there are likely large chunks of it that doesn’t -- is a miracle. A metroswathe is usually not planned to be a swathe, but there are certainly large sections of it that have been developed intentionally, rather than just metastasizing. There are usually vast, baroque criminal, bureaucratic, and community organizations working both above and below board (and street level!).",
  "Union - Administrator's Residence. This world, if it wasn’t previously, is habitable, and has a stable population of millions. A Union Administrator makes their residence here, in as opulent or ascetic conditions as they prefer."
