  "Abandoned Union Navy shipyard, purchased and sold over and over to successive owners until it was eventually hauled out to the Rim. Population can be minor to massive.",
  "A pirate colony based around an old surveying ship permanently fused to its escorts. Now, nominally governed by an anarchist pirate queen. Keeps its doors open to outsiders. Moves every 3-5 local days to avoid detection. Bristling with weapons and thick with armed guards.",
  "IPS-Northstar refueling station, its location widely known. A neutral ground for trade in goods and services. Heavily trafficked by IPS-N’s Trunk Security and serves as a local base for their patrol cutters. The central ring is full of the parked ships of charter captains ready and willing to run any job you need, for the right price.",
  "A long-abandoned mining colony, drilled deep into an enormous asteroid. Most habitation is around its reactor core, where it is warm. The hundreds of miles of tunnels outside are mostly empty, you think. People disappear here often.",
  "An old, quiet Union Naval outpost, barnacled with merchants and traders, small diplomatic offices for the major powers, serviceable bars, official and unofficial checkpoints, and people willing to get you what you need if you’ve got the manna to cover it. Staffed by bored Union personnel mostly there to run customs checks.",
  "An enormous domed Volador trade bazaar with stable artificial gravity. The Voladores have not come in hundreds of subjective years, despite originally building this structure. Outside construction has largely taken it over, and now it serves as the capital station for a powerful enterprise.",
  "A collection of salvaged freighters, leashed together into a massive, rambling habitat full of dark corners, hidden warrens, and secrets. Can, on paper, be moved if enough of the old ship drives can be re-ignited.",
  "A community of hydroponic farming habitats and humble agricultural families built among a collection of leashed asteroids, with a central hub for trade. Rumored to be a popular 'retirement' station for Horizon collectivists, maybe even home to a 'free' NHP. Rather calm and nice.",
  "A decommissioned Armory legion post from the first Dawnline colonization push, now a playground for long-haul freighter crews. Filled with nightclubs, gambling dens, and pleasure houses — as with most places in the Rim, anything goes here if you’ve got the manna. Popular with professional pirates from many of the enterprises, who meet there as a neutral ground to have a good time.",
  "A hollowed-out asteroid or massive cylinder ship with an expansive station built on the inside surface, spinning at a comfortable 1g. The metropolis on the inside is home to hundreds of thousands of souls, and is petitioning Union for official state recognition."
