  "A fleet of asteroids rich in rare minerals, leashed into a closely-guarded orbit and protected by loyal cosmopolitan guards.",
  "The only pilots capable of navigating a treacherous corridor through anti-blink space, and the knowledge to train more.",
  "The single best supply of fresh water and the ability to hygienically process, package, and distribute it.",
  "A collection of fabrication plants able to produce GMS hulls, components, and parts; for the right price, they can procure licensed materials as well.",
  "A reliable method of contacting los Voladores, plus first pick of prime Volador artifacts, goods, and technology to outfit their stations with.",
  "The contract to guarantee passage for IPS-N bureaucrats from Rao Co Station to the Dawnline Shore, as well as support from IPS-N Trunk Security forces.",
  "The ability to produce blink transponder codes capable of clearing Union code-checks, and the largesse to reward their people with them.",
  "A monopoly on viable cloning processes and the accounts of the leadership of many — if not all — of the other enterprises.",
  "Their strength guaranteed — via clandestine channels — by one of the galaxy's major powers with interests in the Dawnline Shore (either Harrison Armory or the Karrakin Trade Barons).",
  "The standard currency that Long Rim populations use, bank, and trade with (until they can convert it into manna, that is)."

  "A kind but low-level member. No real power in the enterprise, other than their word and the largesse of their commanding officer, manager, or foreman.",

  "Meagre. They're allowed to exist by the other enterprises on account of their usefulness as a dumping ground, patsy, or easy victim. No one works with them for long, and it's likely only a matter of time before their last remaining station falls to one of the other enterprises.",
  "Modest. They control a modest complement of stations with a small but loyal guard; the bulk of their strength comes from outside hires, who they can afford to pay for their loyalty.",
  "Middling. The number of loyal guard to mercenaries is nearly 1:1. They likely command a series of popular, but not critical stations.",
  "Substantial. The holders of an important checkpoint, fuel, or resupply station, this enterprise can afford to pay their mercenaries well and then some. They feel comfortable bullying smaller enterprises when they must, but generally stick within their lane.",
  "Mighty. In command of a large fighting force and mighty economic base, this enterprise can field older model fighters, bombers, and corvettes, and is likely on the radar of the major powers — for good and for ill. Their influence spreads out into the Long Rim, and they're not afraid to use their power as an implicit or explicit threat to get smaller enterprises to do what they want, and to annex independent stations that they desire.",
  "Legitimate Connections. This enterprise has clandestine or overt connections to one of the major powers with an interest in the Dawnline Shore; this legitimacy insulates them from some enforcement by that major power, and has had a marked economic benefit for them as well.",
  "Knowledge. This enterprise may or may not be mighty in military strength, but they guard a deep, secret knowledge that all of the other enterprises and major powers value — unfortunately for the other powers, they're damn good at not giving up the knowledge without being paid to do so, and are necessary to keep around for now.",
  "Coin. This enterprise is one of the wealthiest and likely sets the terms by which all others conduct their markets and economic affairs. Managing the economy is a hassle for the other enterprises, but participating in it is an unassailable boon. For the time being, the other enterprises are happy to let this one continue to manage the Rim's accounts, be the target of their collective grumblings, and prevent all-out war in doing so.",
  "Goods. This enterprise has multiple monopolies on necessary luxury goods that are difficult or costly to procure; the other enterprises don't have the capacity to produce this/these goods, and are content to let this enterprise take the lead. While other enterprises may gripe about the price, they generally all have a favorable view of this enterprise on account of the good(s) the produce.",
  "Titanic. They control multiple refurbished warships, crewed by veteran spacers and disciplined marines loyal to the enterprise. At their command is a force of well-seasoned fighters thousands strong, as well as a few ex-lancer-tier pilots in their personal chassis. No other enterprise will face them down, as that would certainly mean total destruction. The major powers have extensive dossiers on this enterprise's personnel, and likely have contingency plans to strike and eliminate its leaders and military might if need be; by the same token, this enterprise may have designs beyond the Long Rim."
