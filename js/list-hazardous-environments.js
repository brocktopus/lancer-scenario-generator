"<strong>Dangerous Flora or Fauna.</strong> The planet has a high amount of dangerous animal or plant life, some of it perhaps titanic, predatory, or particularly hostile. You can represent this by using the Monstrosity NPC type from the NPC toolkit. You can also represent the presence of hostile flora on a battlefield as size 1 or 2 immobile characters with evasion 10, 5 hp. Any target that moves adjacent to them must pass a hull check or take 3 kinetic damage and become immobilized by sticky sap, webbing, a pit trap, or the like until the flora is destroyed.",
"<strong>Extreme Cold.</strong> Mechs and pilots will quickly freeze without a source of heat nearby, and culture on this world accommodates this. Any mech that does not move or boost on its turn becomes immobilized at the end of its turn. It can end this condition by taking a quick action and making a successful hull check to break out of the ice. All mechs have resistance to heat.",
"<strong>Extreme Heat.</strong> Civilization has retreated mostly underground in this blistering atmosphere. All systems and weapons that generate or inflict heat generate +1 more heat than normal.",
"<strong>Thin Atmosphere.</strong> All characters gain resistance to explosive damage.",
"<strong>Extreme Sun.</strong> Characters take 1d6 heat at the end of any turn that they are not standing in the shade.",
"<strong>Corrosive Atmosphere.</strong> The thick atmosphere on this world corrodes armor. All weapons gain the AP tag.",
"<strong>Particulate Storm.</strong> This planet is swept by brutal, scouring storms of sand, rock, or metal. While one of these storms is active, mechs treat all areas as soft cover. Pilots that step outside their mech take 1 AP kinetic damage a turn for each turn they are outside of shelter.",
"<strong>Electric Storm.</strong> This planet is swept by unusually strong electrical storms. While one of these storm is active, at the end of the round, choose a character at random. That character must pass an engineering save with 1 difficulty per size or be stunned until the end of their next turn by a bolt of lightning.",
"<strong>Disruptive Storm.</strong> The storms on this planet are so thick that electronic systems cannot function. All tech actions, attacks, and system checks and saves are made at +1 difficulty.",
"<strong>Dangerous Storm.</strong> This planet is swept by storms of fire, meteors, acid rain, ice, or other destructive particles. While one of these storms is active, all characters not adjacent to an object that grants hard cover at the end of their turn take 2 AP energy damage.",
"<strong>Earthquakes.</strong> At the end of each round, while earthquakes are active on this world, roll a 1d6. On a 1, all mechs on the battlefield that aren’t flying must pass a hull save or be knocked prone.",
"<strong>Ocean World.</strong> This entire world is covered in water, with less than 5% of the surface being solid ground. Mechs with flying or EVA can move normally, otherwise mechs without will sink to the bottom and count movement as difficult terrain. They can walk perfectly normally on the bottom (if slowly) and most mechs are pressure rated to extremely high specifications.",
"<strong>Molten World.</strong> Parts of this world’s crust pokes through in showers and pools of liquid rock. Any character that enters a zone of molten rock or lava for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there takes 5 AP energy damage and 3 heat.",
"<strong>Primordial World.</strong> This world is mostly a bubbling soup of semi-organic mud and gases. The atmosphere is toxic and humans must use a breathing apparatus or sealed suits outside of their mechs. Boiling mud covers this world, creating zones of both difficult and dangerous terrain.",
"<strong>Low Gravity.</strong> All mechs gain the ability to fly when they boost on this world, but must land after they move. Characters never take damage from falling.",
"<strong>High Gravity.</strong> Mechs cannot boost on this high gravity world and are immobilized instead of Slowed.",
"<strong>Tomb World.</strong> This world has extremely high radiation, possibly as a result of nuclear war, atmospheric degradation, or something more sinister. Humans not wearing a sealed hard suit or some other kind of environmental suit lose 1 maximum HP per hour they spend exposed. If that reduces them to 0 HP or lower, they die. They can recover from this exposure and regain their maximum HP by taking a full repair somewhere not exposed.",
"<strong>Spire World.</strong> This world is made up of a large number of islands or spires held aloft in a gaseous substrate and suspended through magnetic force. Perhaps it was a world shattered by a superweapon or natural disaster. Most of the land is not connected, but a loose collection of floating rocks, some of them large enough to hold cities. Navigation systems go haywire on this world.",
"<strong>Sinking World.</strong> This world is covered in fine sand or thick mud. While on the surface, mechs that move 1 space or less during their turn are Slowed. Mechs that are Slowed and move 1 space or less are immobilized and start sinking, eventually becoming completely engulfed. A mech can take a full action and make a hull save to end this effect on itself or another adjacent mech.",
"<strong>Holy World.</strong> This world is beautiful and has no particular dangerous features, but held sacrosanct by the local population. Damaging any natural object: its rocks, trees, and pristine grasslands, for example, will incur the ire or wrath of the locals."
