[
"The local leader is hostile to Union, and will send their agents, military, or assassins to try and stop you.",
"The location of the mission is under local quarantine, due to the presence of a virulent, deadly illness.",
"The location of this mission is secret, and your presence there will be deniable: expect no support or public reward for completing your objectives.",
"The local gravity is much higher than you’re used to, making movement and breathing more difficult.",
"The atmosphere is corrosive and thick, rendering all but the most powerful energy weapons useless.",
"The world is marked by odd, unnatural geometries -- certain features, when the wind blows over them, “sing”, and the world is never silent.",
"The world is a frequent (enough) target of meteorite impacts: one is forecasted within the mission window, and its impact will plunge the world into a decade of dust-night and storms.",
"The world is in turmoil, roiling with political discontent, and you’ve just stepped in the middle of it.",
"The station is a common type among long-term-residency stations: a cylinder, whose population lives on the gentle curve of the cylinder’s interior. You’ll need to take that into account when the mission gets hot.",
"The weapon, VIP, ship, etc, that you’re escorting will intersect with an opposing weapon, VIP, ship, etc, that the enemy is escorting: you must ensure that your objective remains secure, while theirs is done away with.",
"The station you’re on begins to break apart after the shooting starts.",
"The forces employed by your enemy are unwilling combatants, coerced into fighting you.",
"Your mission runs counter to the mission of another arm of your state, company, or agency; you may encounter internal resistance.",
"Your way in is incapacitated or made unavailable, leaving you without a clear way out.",
"Your intel was wrong -- the objective you seek is not where you were told it would be.",
"The city’s (or station’s) administrative NHP dislikes you, for reasons unknown, and seeks to impede your progress.",
"The world has a much longer day/night cycle, lasting on the order of standard months or more -- you’re approaching the end of one period and the beginning of the other, with significant cultural meaning placed on the transition, and wide variance in how the local biome reacts.",
"Completing the mission requires some interstellar transit, which would divorce you from the subjective timeline of your friends and family back home.",
"This mission is set up to fail, but you don’t know that yet. Someone higher up in your organization wants you dead.",
"The world has been visited previously by RA, and it bears markings of the MONIST entity's passing."
