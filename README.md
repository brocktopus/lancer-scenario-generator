# Lancer RPG: Basic Mission/Scenario Generator

This is a pretty simple randomizer that will generate some basic parameters for a mission in the [_Lancer_ tabletop RPG](https://twitter.com/Lancer_RPG) by Tom Parkinson Morgan and Miguel Lopez.

View randomized scenarios from the core book at http://brocktopus.github.io/lancer-scenario-generator/

View randomized space station-related info from the _Long Rim_ supplement at http://brocktopus.github.io/lancer-scenario-generator/long-rim.html

In the near future, I hope to improve the granularity and variety of randomized elements so as to produce a much wider, and hopefully more interesting, range of potential missions/scenarios.


## Other (and Better) Community Resources

While this is a pretty simple project, there are some awesome initiatives out there providing players and GMs with useful resources to play the game. These include:

* [_Lancer_ Community Edition](https://github.com/AshleyMoni/Lancer-Community-Edition)
* [_Lancer_ Wiki](http://lancer.wiki)
* [Comp/Con](https://beeftime.itch.io/compcon)
* [_Lancer_ Encounter Designer](https://github.com/aritsune/lancer-encounter-designer)
