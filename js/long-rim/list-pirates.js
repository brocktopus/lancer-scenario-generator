  "Toll taking: Exaction of rent, bribes, tribute, or labor from local stations, freighters, or other passers-by.",
  "Trafficking: smuggling people (natural born, facsimile, or flash clones), typically for unpaid labor (i.e. slavers).",
  "Hijacking: Taking control of ships directly, typically for ransom, but sometimes for parts.",
  "Smuggling: surreptitious transport of goods (illicit, normal, or unsavory) to avoid tariffs, taxes, embargoes, blockades, or fees.",
  "Monopoly: absolute control in local space of a necessary resource, such as fuel, water, or food.",
  "Kidnapping: stealing of VIPs to use as hostages in order to demand ransom payments.",
  "Raiding: direct, violent assault on passing ships or vulnerable stations to forcibly take resources or people for use or sale.",
  "Mercenaries: soldiers for hire on a contract basis.",
  "Narcotics: manufacture and distribution of narcotics.",
  "Horde: a rare type of group that is constantly on the move. No allies, but may have cowed or oppressed populations, commanded through fear of punishment. A horde largely survives solely by raiding stations or ships that they deem vulnerable and valuable. Typically grows by raiding and pressing captives into service, or by drawing from cowed populations under threat of death. Rarely lasts more than a few months before dispersing, though some are large enough to persist in an almost seasonal or tidal surge and drought."

  "A fully armed warship kept in excellent shape. This ship was taken from a state navy or Union and is an older model, but still deadly compared to other ships in the Rim. It has a spinal cannon or significant ordinance in addition to plentiful batteries of cannons or lances, and is capable of destroying a station if its commander wishes. It might be used as a mobile base of operations.",
  "A well-armed squad of 4-5 Elite mech chassis.",
  "An extremely well hidden base, located in a cloud of debris or “dead” zone that confuses sensors.",
  "A titanic, one-off mech. You can use the Ultra template and change the mech size to 4 to represent this. The mech is well armored enough to tackle ships and may require multiple pilots to crew.",
  "An NHP that acts as a powerful advisor or a de-facto leader. Rare in the Rim, this NHP is well managed by its technicians, and grants a powerful advantage to its organization.",
  "A powerful hacking corps that works out of an old communication station, able to steal ships and redirect supplies without firing a shot. Typically they try to avoid direct conflict.",
  "A long range space-to-space kinetic weapon platform that can easily disable passing ships and threaten stations. Has a power source buried inside an asteroid and can only fire once an hour or so.",
  "A small army (~50-100 units) of combat subalterns armed with energy weapons.",
  "A sub-blink snare - a temperamental, nonlethal anti-ship system that can disable ships' reactors without harming their crew. Needs a central activator on a ship or nearby station to hold a ship in place.",
  "A leashed asteroid at least 10km in diameter. Can be redirected, albeit slowly, to threaten stations or ships."
