[
	"100 year storms with increasing regularity -- typically manifests as massive hurricanes.",
	"Very active tectonics -- earthquakes are more common on this world than others. On ocean worlds, this means a higher prevalence of tsunamis.",
	"Inert core -- this world’s core has stopped spinning, and as a result it has shed its magnetic field. Compasses do not work on this world, and UV exposure is dangerous without significant protection.",
	"Monobiome -- this world is an oddity among worlds, in that has a single, global biome with a single, global climate. It could be a forest that spans the world, or a desert, a swamp, and so on.",
	"Worldscar - the world has suffered a recent (within a million years) impact from a massive stellar body. Its climate has leveled, but the scar of the impact is still a massive, visible feature on the world’s surface.",
	"Royal Court - the world has hundreds of terrestrial moons, ranging from hundreds of yards in diameter to thousands of kilometers. The night sky is bright, and the day is marked by gentle, dappled light.",
	"Under Twin Suns - the world orbits a binary star.",
	"Ringed - the world is banded in a series of planetary rings, visible as a thin white line across the night sky. It is an especially beautiful world to view from afar.",
	"Remote - this world was a remote colonial, industrial, or scientific prospect. It is far removed from any other civilization, and takes great effort and time to reach.",
	"Cosmopolitan - this world is located close to interstellar shipping lanes, and is a frequent landmark, resupply point, or pit stop for interstellar travellers, who ether remain in orbit or have an easy route down to the surface of the world.",
	"Hecatoncheires - The world is marked by a series of massive mountains, sheer peaks rising kilometers into the sky.",
	"Epochal Sunset - the world is gripped by the transition between eras -- ice to temperate, temperate to ice, and so on. Expect a varied climate.",
	"A Monument of Shame - the world is a dumping ground for passing ships, for a local CS, or abandoned following massive climate destabilization.",
	"Quarantined - the world has been hidden behind Union red tape, for reasons unknown or known.",
	"Breathable Atmosphere - the world, unless already noted, has a breathable atmosphere. A human can breathe without relying on an EVA, scrubbers, or other assistance or augmentation.",
	"High Gravity - the world, in addition to any other features, has higher than standard gravity, ranging from +1-2G greater than Cradle standard.",
	"Low Gravity - the world, in addition to any other features, has lower than standard gravity, ranging from .1-.99G less than Cradle standard.",
	"Hard Sun - in addition to any other features noted in its description, this world’s atmosphere provides little to no UV protection. Venturing outside in the daylight is a risk without proper optical and dermal shielding.",
	"Dreamland - in addition to any other features noted in its description, this world has something dreamlike about it that makes it stand out. Islands that float suspended in the air, or oceans of liquid mercury, or motile fauna, and so on.",
	"Dust and Echoes - the world has ancient, pre-collapse ruins on it, with no indication as to their origin or nature. Only mystery, and ruins worn to the root."
