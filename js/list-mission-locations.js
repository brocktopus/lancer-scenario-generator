"On a habitable, terrestrial, populated world, with a few large cities, a capital with a spaceport, and outlying towns. Vast stretches of unexploited, but explored wilderness.",
"On a terrestrial world with little to no atmosphere. Rocky, uninhabited, with a smattering of automated sig/int, omni, and navigational stations.",
"On a high-traffic, low-orbit civilian station, full of travellers bound for distant stars and Cosmopolitans waiting to clear quarantine.",
"Inside a massive arcology, thick with life, an oasis on an otherwise grim world.",
"In hard vacuum, near a dorsal monitoring terminal of a Blink station’s Dyson panel, thousands of kilometers above the city decks.",
"Aboard a capital ship, all decks vented of air and ready for combat.",
"On an arid terrestrial world close to its sun, in a white sand desert of massive marching dunes and glass spires.",
"On a cold, distal world of black stone and vast, geometric planes of nitrogen ice.",
"Inside the upper atmosphere of a massive gas giant, where long-flight hydrogen refineries scrape the valuable fuel from impossible blue depths.",
"Among the teeming streets, bazaars, and boulevards of an ancient, persistent metroswathe, laden with millennia of histories, both personal and public.",
"On an ocean world, landmasses covered by glaciers and the mountains they’ve carved as they march to the sea. Storms marble the world’s grey skies, and turbulent tectonic activity sends world-sweeping tidal waves to crash into glacial faces.",
"On a rocky world defined by massive craters, whose skies are lit by the brilliant passage of frequent meteor showers.",
"On a hot, terrible world of choking gases and thick atmospheres, where light is eaten by deep yellow fog, and the ground is a barren mix of oily green stone and rotting metals.",
"Aboard a vibrant Cosmopolitan space station, a hub of intergalactic trade and art, with constituent asteroidal states leashed in its orbit.",
"In the arcadian planes of a temperate world, distant from any human habitation, but marked by the promise of future colonization.",
"On the storied land of an old Core world, once a thriving metropole, now long since scaled back. Empty cities collect sand and creeping vines; the world’s population resides in a single valley, content.",
"On a bucolic temporal reserve, a neo-pastoral world with a population that has no knowledge of Union or the politics and current events of the galaxy at large.",
"In the hard vacuum of space, among the ruins of the fleet.",
"In the hard vacuum of space, between the ink-black hulls of capital ships on long patrol.",
"On the hardpack surface of a comet, whose horizon is never far away, whose chasms and valleys are picked out in sharp relief by the hard light of a nearby star."
