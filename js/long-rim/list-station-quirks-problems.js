  "Open air produce market along the spinal corridor for local families (every three core standard days). The produce is grown in bags and tends to be oddly shaped and very juicy. Most spacers prefer it that way.",
  "A wizened man who can see the future with about 50% accuracy for any given reading (you can roll for this if you like). He can't see into the future more than about a day or so and lives mostly off donations as a hermit. Claims to be ex-UIB and acquired his abilities during clandestine operations.",
  "Large population of feral kraits. A krait is an approximately dog-sized crustacean that has adapted almost perfectly for life in space stations. They make excellent pets, produce very little waste, and consume very little food and water.",
  "Cluttered chop shop for cyberware and prosthetics, as well as a low-cost wetware-installation and repair facility. Run by an aging doctor with increasingly poor hearing and eyesight, who enjoys healthy respect and business from the locals. Clean, despite appearances.",
  "Daily water hub where locals must show up to receive their water ration. Has transformed over time into an impromptu social club and cafe where the local variety of tea and biscuits is served in bulk, and for very cheap. Remains open around the clock despite the distribution period only being a few hours.",
  "Exposed thermal pipes where most of the locals do their cooking, despite the complaints from engineering. Sweltering and full of amazing smells.",
  "HORUS technocult blister, attached to the side of the station by a punch corridor and a number of umbilicals. Trades for food with the locals in return for information services. Station admin steadfastly denies their existence, despite their operation being in plain sight.",
  "Gang of station kids who will trade information for off-station food (candy is vastly preferred). They seem to be able to get into nearly everywhere on the station (including off-limits or clandestine areas) and are total shitkickers in a fight.",
  "A man called 'The Groundskeeper' who has a reputation as a master forger. He can spoof most IFF signatures, ship transponders, badges of office, or official papers - for a price. Lives in a ramshackle barge attached to the station, but ready to leave any time.",
  "Home to an old Schedule 2 printer. In terrible shape and clogged with back-orders. Run by an overworked officer whose operating floor space is about 90% paperwork and old servers by volume.",
  "'The best burger joint in the Orion arm,' run by a Sparri techno-shaman who claims to have invented a new stasis freezing technique to keep meat fresh on long haul journeys. Don't ask too much about it or they get testy. The burgers live up to the hype.",
  "A humble shrine or fine temple to Christ the Buddha, usually adorned with lanterns. Please remove shoes before entering.",
  "Cramped but characterful cinema run by an enthusiast who grew up in the Rim. Slightly outdated and tends to get the most recent stuff from the Capital worlds pretty late; in the meantime, has well-curated programming of old films.",
  "Opulent pleasure barge that has become stranded at the station for several weeks. The SSC executive who resides there is extremely upset at the refueling delay, which they expect is intentional, and is eager for help in freeing themselves from the administrative and bureaucratic red tape keeping them there.",
  "Gambling and gaming hall built alongside the main concourse. Populated all all hours, doubles as a bar and smoking lounge. The popular Sparri board game kapkat is played here, and the sound of jingling machines can be heard up and down nearby areas of the station. Often hosts live shows and impromptu fights.",
  "An inactive IPS-N Tortuga that has been melded into the station wall and serves as a power source. Seen as a mascot or guardian by locals.",
  "Back-alley maintenance access corridor behind a bar where you can find Gliss. The crustaceans are a powerful narcotic and most people smoke them right out of the shells.",
  "Overgrown hydro farm that has broken into the station's pipes, causing large parts of the station to be humid and lush with dark green or purple foliage. Rather than clear out the growth, the station managers have turned the overgrown areas into resources for station food, medicine, and trade goods.",
  "Weapons dealer that does business out of an old apartment stack. Always has coffee brewing. Employs a large population of aging and imported IPS-N subalterns to do business. Friendly to you, but you know it's all business.",
  "The House of Cats. Jazz cafe, bar, restaurant, gambling parlor, and house of courtesans. Never closed, extremely loud, and designed to drain all your loose manna or station credit. Garishly decorated in the style of old earth palatial estates. A fun time, but getting too attached is dangerous."

  "The station's orbit is decaying and it will fall into the nearest star/planetary body in the next year or so. Deadlock between engineering and leadership has prevented anything from being done about this.",
  "A cycle of blood debts has led to a huge feud between several families on the station. Knife and gunfights in the street are common, and the local population that hasn't fled have gone into lockdown.",
  "The station's life support is in desperate need of repair. Parts of the station have no light, air, or are massively hot or cold — to make matters worse, the engineering team sent into Life Support to fix the problem never fixed it, never returned, and won't respond to communications requests.",
  "A Volador has died of (apparent) natural causes while on an emissary mission to the station: there is absolutely no protocol for how to deal with burial, and station leadership doesn't know how to get in contact with los Voladores to let them know.",
  "The station admin's child has gone missing.",
  "The station has a problematic infestation of unusually large predatory kraits plaguing the maintenance and hydroponics decks.",
  "A corrupt political boss holds sway over station resources and refuses to budge without proper deference or bribes. They claim they are bringing order to the station, and have given the population an ultimatum delivered at the barrels of their security forces' guns: knuckle under, or get spaced.",
  "There's been another gruesome murder, the third in a month. It's clear now: there's a serial killer on the station.",
  "The stations' spin sections are out of alignment, and on occasion the wobbling toruses spin a little too close, causing 'gravity' outages and wild fluctuations. It needs fixing, and soon: station engineers predict that, left unfixed, these gravity fluctuations could tear the station apart.",
  "An unregistered skip vessel from the Dawnline Shore has docked at the station. The passengers claim to be political dissidents in need of sanctuary, parking a divisive debate aboard the station: some think they should be granted asylum, while others fret about the station's resource budget. All the while, an Armory (or Barony) patrol burns towards the station, sure to spark a confrontation when they arrive.",
  "A pirate or marauder band has parked nearby and frequently raids the station or its visitors to exact tribute. The station's enterprise is refusing to send protection teams until the locals pony up and pay for missing protection payments, so the raids continue; the people are in need of help, but 'helping' is sure to piss off both the marauder's enterprise and the local station's enterprise.",
  "An apocalyptic cult has filtered through the station, placing some of their adherents in important infrastructure and security positions. Left unchecked, their eschatological designs will see the end of the station and — possibly — extend into nearby sectors of the Long Rim.",
  "The station is a de-facto haven for narcotic smugglers. Gliss, Brighteyes, Gazer — whatever you want, you can get it here. The only problem is, these smugglers are unaffiliated, and a pair of rival enterprises seem ready to 'negotiate' ownership, whether the station wants to or not.",
  "Supplies are critically short and hoarding is commonplace; regular shipments have been 'delayed' by a local cordon — either by an enterprise or one a more above-board power — and the locals are getting desperate for relief...",
  "The station has grown in population enormous in recent years and is under strain; some factions argue that exodus is necessary, while others advocate for opening up long-sealed sections of the station and exploiting the open space. Those sections, though, have been sealed for a reason...",
  "A popular revolution has recently overthrown the station's previous owners and the situation is still volatile; the revolutionary group has issued a broad-band call for support and fighters, but this has also alerted a nearby enterprise that sees this as an opportunity for them to expand their own territory.",
  "The station was recently abandoned by Harrison Armory, who pulled almost all funding, resources, and security and left without explanation. The local population, beleaguered, searches for answers, meanwhile a skeleton team of Armory personnel can be seen operating behind sealed sections of the station, unresponsive to the local populations' petitions for information.",
  "A Sparri mercenary company rolls through at regular intervals and trashes the place with wild partying. They're good business, but they leave a mess, and it's starting to grate on the locals.",
  "A HORUS cell keeps threatening to redirect an asteroid into the station if they are not paid at regular intervals.",
  "The station is a neutral territory for a number of Rim enterprises who use it as a marketplace and diplomatic hub — so when its main concourse is bombed, the enterprises all suspect each other, and the tenuous diplomatic arrangement begins to grow more and more tense..."
